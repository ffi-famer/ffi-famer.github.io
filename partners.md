The University of Gothenburg  (UGOT) plays a central role in the FAMER project, coordinating the overall efforts and contributing significantly to multiple work packages. Specifically, the University of Gothenburg's involvement includes:

**Project Coordination:** UGOT coordinates the project, ensuring the effective collaboration of all partners and overseeing project management activities. This includes organizing bi-weekly project meetings, managing a collaboration platform, and coordinating dissemination activities.

**Work Package Leadership** 

WP2: Requirements Representation: UGOT leads this work package, focusing on developing effective representations and strategies for capturing requirements for safe perception systems. This includes structuring and inter-relating requirements, specifying both functional and non-functional requirements, and ensuring traceability of requirements to fulfil ISO 26262.

WP5: Project Management and Dissemination: UGOT leads this work package, ensuring proper project coordination, dissemination of results through national and international networks, and management of relations with related projects.

**Participation in Other Work Packages**

 WP1: Shared Language: UGOT participates by helping to establish a shared language and reference information model for safe perception systems, contributing their expertise in requirements engineering and agile systems development.

WP3: Annotation Requirements Verification and Validation: UGOT contributes to defining annotation needs and constraints, as well as verifying and validating annotated data to ensure it meets system-level goals.

WP4: Multi-Party Requirements Cognition: UGOT contributes by compiling FAMER results into training materials and facilitating focus group research to integrate FAMER contributions into multi-party distributed agile development approaches.

Zenseact plays a significant role in the FAMER project, contributing to multiple work packages with a focus on integrating collaborative requirements engineering across the automotive value chain. Their involvement includes:

**Work Package Leadership**  

WP4: Multi-Party Requirements Cognition: Zenseact leads this work package, defining how FAMER contributions can positively impact the automotive value chain and enable the distributed building of requirements knowledge across multiple partners in typical automotive scaled agile systems development. They are responsible for integrating FAMER results into agile automotive systems development and evaluating feasibility and benefits based on a concrete case study .

**Participation in Other Work Packages** 

WP1: Shared Language: Zenseact collaborates with other partners to review standards and reference frameworks, define a reference information model, and develop a reference system architecture description for perception systems.

WP2: Requirements Representation: Zenseact works alongside other partners to extend shared understanding from WP1, define requirements representations and methods, and develop a traceability information model that connects various representations.

WP3: Annotation Requirements Verification and Validation: Zenseact, together with Kognic, leads tasks related to defining annotation needs and constraints, creating annotated data, and validating whether this data meets system-level goals. They focus on ensuring that annotated data contributes to fulfilling safety and other high-level requirements.

WP5: Project Management and Dissemination: Zenseact supports project management activities and dissemination efforts, promoting project results and managing relations with related projects. They participate in bi-weekly project meetings and other coordination activities.
